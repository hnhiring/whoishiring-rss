Actively | Software Engineers (LLM/backend/data infra, very product-y) &amp; Solutions Engineers (great data/SQL chops, great at understanding customer problems, and strong engineer in general to automate work using LLMs/internal tools) | Full-time | NYC | OnsiteI'm one of the founders of Actively. We're building best-in-class machine learning and LLM-powered scoring for outbound sales teams. Our first product lives in Salesforce, ingests data from a variety of sources (firmographics, intent signals, marketing interactions, and prior engagement, including unstructured call transcripts, email chains, and notes), and combines LLMs with structured models to tell sales reps who they should reach out to each day (and why) to be laser-focused.Our paying customers are fast-growing unicorns you've definitely heard of with large outbound sales motions, where the reps use us to target their outbound every day. Our thesis is that scoring (a known/"need to have" part of the stack -- but able to be done 10x better with LLMs because you can incorporate the goldmine of unstructured engagement data) is the right wedge into building the intelligence-driven outbound sales stack of the future that _actually works_ for large companies that need to generate millions of dollars in pipeline each quarter. Unlike most other companies in the space, we are explicitly building for companies of this scale and have them using our product today "in production." We have a 100% close rate from pilot → paying customer and want to scale our customer base aggressively this year.We started with the vision of bringing AI to every business team, and have since narrowed down to focus on outbound sales teams who have a bunch of attractive properties (there are a _ton_ of them out there, they all use the same stack, the data is consolidated in one place, lift is measurable and directly touches the top line, etc.).We're a team of 6 working in-person in NYC with a team from Scale/Waymo/Google/etc. (including some very senior folks) and looking to bring on a couple more engineers as we start scaling our customer base, in both product &amp; solutions engineering roles. If you have at least a few years of experience, are highly entrepreneurial / excited to work closely with customers + dig in across the business, and are excited to work on some combination of LLMs/data infra/across the stack, we would love to chat: mihir [at] actively.ai!Keywords: AI, ML, LLMs, machine learning, Salesforce, explainable AI, product engineering, SQL, solutions engineering, data infrastructure

Lunaris | Engineering | Tokyo, Japan | On-site | Visa sponsorship | Full Time | https://teamlunaris.com/Lunaris started out as an otaku-centric online shop called Solaris Japan founded in 2008, and is still going strong to this day. As such, many of us here have a huge passion for anime, gaming, or Japanese pop culture in general. It’s not unusual to see an anime figure sitting on someone’s desk, the latest League of Legends tournament streaming on our lounge television, or hear someone discussing their past adventures on Final Fantasy XI.However, our passion doesn’t stop there – we’re a team of self-starters who are driven by results. As Solaris Japan continued its success and our customer base grew, we sought solutions to serve our customers, and added Shopify to our toolkit. We then built a number of custom applications for ourself and automated many of our processes, and realized we could offer these solutions to other e-commerce platforms as well. Thus, Lunaris was born, and with it additional e-commerce solutions like easyPoints, easyRates, and more.We are a team of international engineers, and are actively seeking a few more engineers to join our growing team:- Senior/Lead Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/senior-lead-developer- Fullstack Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/full-stack-developerTech stack: Elixir, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, React (mostly JS)If Lunaris sounds like a good fit for you, and you're ready for a new experience in Japan (or already living here), please check out the above positions and send in your application.Of course, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach us at jobs@lunaris.jp

[Position closed] We got many applicants and closed this position. I appreciate all of your interest and attention. Thank you.--Monochrome | Backend Engineers | Full-Time | Motely remote but sometimes onsite (Tokyo/Kanagawa in Japan) |At Monochrome Inc., we are designing and developing next-generation smart homes. Our vision is to transform houses so we make the living experience sustainable and yet convenient. We have two product lines. 
One is Roof-1 which is a solar panel, and unlike the conventional solar panels, the color and texture of the module is well-designed so it’s hard to distinguish the roof and module. Architectural designers in Japan love that appearance, and we have high demand since last year.
Another product is Home-1 which is a built-in IoT system: automated lighting, curtains, heating and cooling, smart locks, distribution board, and more, all preconfigured to work out-of-the-box. Best of all, you’ll have seamless control of your home through our beautiful UI, which you can access through a touchscreen built into the house or through your phone.We are seed-stage Tokyo startup (will have the series-A round soon) with a top-tier international team. If you’re passionate about making a big impact in smart homes, automation, or the environment, this is the place for you.
We’ll offer stock options for new hires.We’re looking for people who can build systems to control and automate IoT system via bluetooth, WiFi, or wired connections. We usually use Golang and Python, but we’re very flexible and open to choose any technology if it makes sense to use. We use Debian as a central controller, so this position requires knowledge of Linux systems. It's preferable if you have the basic knowledge/skill of web development, such as RDS/NoSQL and HTTP/socket.io communications.Some of our employees have relocated to Tokyo and the company can support relocation and VISA. 
Remote work is welcome in this company, and most developers are working remotely, but it’s necessary for this role to sometimes go onsite and check how devices work with your programs.If you are interested in visiting our website, here’s the link but unfortunately it’s only in Japanese. https://www.monochrome.so/If you have any questions or wish to apply for the position, please send an email to so[at]monochrome.so with your inquiries or your resume. Thank you.

Where other AI companies see only words, we see the other half of human communication: subtle tones of voice, word emphasis, facial expression, and more.

We currently provide API access to our expression measurement models to help developers build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more, optimizing their products for human well-being. We're also building a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind empathic voice assistant.We're seeking technical talent interested in working with our research team to build state-of-the-art LLMs and scale up our systems. Our new LLM training method - reinforcement learning from human expression (RLHE) - learns human preferences from behavior in millions of audio and video recordings, making LLMs superhumanly helpful, interesting, funny, eloquent, honest, and altruistic. Join us in the heart of New York City and contribute to our endeavor to ensure that AI is guided by human values, the most pivotal challenge and opportunity of the 21st century.As part of our mission, we also conduct groundbreaking scientific research, publish in leading scientific journals like Nature, and support a non-profit, The Hume Initiative, that has released the first concrete ethical guidelines for empathic AI (www.thehumeinitiative.org).You can learn more about us on our website (https://hume.ai/) and read about us in Axios (https://www.axios.com/2023/01/26/startup-ai-emotions-hume) and The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/17/artific...).

You'll get to build a deep understanding of this fast-evolving space, design greenfield developer interfaces and infrastructure, and co-create the culture of what could become a generational company.Because we're building an ambitious developer product, we're extremely selective with early hires. We're looking for engineers who are extraordinarily meticulous about the foundations, really sweat the details when designing interfaces, abstractions, and infrastructure, and are willing to wear the many hats we'll need to scale this business.Our founding team is a group of friends that have known each other for the last decade since meeting at Venmo in 2013. Rob (CEO) was the founding engineer at Substack, Smalltalk, and Fin.com. He’s been hacking on GPU pipelines for years, and built AI features for startups before realizing he should be building reusable infra instead. Ben (Cofounder) spent the last 8+ years at Stripe, where he led mobile and was the founding engineer on Stripe Terminal. Liam (founding engineer) spent the last 8 years at Grailed, recently acquired by GOAT.We've raised a large seed round from notable VCs, the founders of Vercel, Venmo, Substack, and others.Apply: Email ben@substrate.run with your resumeMore info: https://publish.obsidian.md/-/Join+Substrate

Stainless | Founding Engineer and Contract Designer | NYC ONSITE | Full-time or ContractStainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs.Our first product is SDKs as a service. When you `npm install openai` or `pip install openai`, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated.(I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.We’re about 2y old, under 10 people, have strong revenue, and are selling to companies you interact with every day (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare are all customers). We’re backed by Sequoia.As a founding engineer, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, competitive salary, and a very competitive ownership stake.As a designer, you’ll be building the future of API documentation alongside the lead engineer on Stripe’s current API docs design, and some rich, interesting devtool products.We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.Want to build the future of API tooling?

It's surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It's the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I'm an early Uber engineer.We are on the lookout for a hands-on engineering manager for our application and data teams. Our application team builds what our end-users experience; a lightning fast and easy-to-use mapping tool that works in the browser. We are primarily using Elixir / Phoenix on the server side and have a spatially focused React on the frontend side. As an engineering manager, you'll be working with folks who are experts in their field [2], release more than 15+ a day [3], and aren't afraid to break new ground when necessary [4].Our data team makes geospatial datasets a breeze to work with and we are currently building our next-generation of our data stack on AWS. The team you'll be managing is full of expert engineers from Facebook, Carto, Mapbox, and Uber. You might have used their work in mapping already; such as Tippecanoe. We also recently announced our sponsorship of QGIS [5] and have some amazing stuff planned in the next couple of quarters.We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [6], and our announcement here [6]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[7]If you are an experienced manager, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN.[1] https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-r...

BRINC Drones | https://brincdrones.com/ | Onsite in Seattle | Full-time | $150-225k + equityBRINC Drones helps first responders with products that quickly and effectively respond to emergencies. Our technology lets first responders get eyes and ears on what's happening in indoor structures when it's too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergency, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.In addition to launching more advanced drones, we're also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps.  This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.It’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.Job Postings:- Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...- Senior/Principal Backend &amp; Platform Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...Some recent press:- https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...- https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/I'm the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about the role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you're interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!

Juniper (YC W21) | Senior Software Engineer, Senior Frontend Engineer | HYBRID NYC | Full-time | juniperplatform.comJuniper operates at the messy infrastructure layer for US Healthcare. We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.We’re changing that.At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)Our typical paid rate is above 95%.We are a team of 25 with STRONG product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.Email me at chris@juniperplatform.com

We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform[1] provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.Over 250k engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models[2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill[3] and Supervision[4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].We have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy &amp; we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can "choose their own loss function". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders &amp; problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)We're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales &amp; field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0124[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring0124[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0124[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow

Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Infrastructure Software Engineer | Bay Area | Full-timeI currently run YC’s infrastructure and I need some help! Over the last 7 years I’ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.The main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You’re probably the person people turn to when there’s a fire to put out.YC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/0Ewh...). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you’re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC’s programs, partners, and founders.If you’re interested, I’d love to chat! I’m mark@ycombinator.com.

Veritably.ai | 100% Remote, anywhere | Founding engineers soughtVeritably is, as yet, a bunch of prototyping looking to become a company. The grand scheme is to become a general document validation/verification automation pipeline. Think, ISO standards compliance.We are currently a two person team working with VisionEncoder/Decoder Models and traditional algorithms (mostly python) to assess the completeness and correctness of documents like ISO 26262 Hazard and Risk assessments.We are looking for engineers with an interest in document processing, standards compliance, Functional Safety and the like to join us in solving some ugly real world problems. Let's face it, modern companies tend to produce documentation in a fairly random mix of 'looks about right' PDFs and excel (tm) spreadsheets. This is time consuming, tedious work that really could use the application of some intelligent machine processing.We're looking for partners, not employees. If your curious, mail: mark.washeim@veritably.ai

Omnigres | Founding Engineer | SF Bay Area HQ | REMOTEAt Omnigres, our north star is to enable developers to laser-focus on business needs instead of fighting technological challenges.
We're fighting the complexity and inefficiencies of contemporary stacks by removing them instead of hiding them.At the core, we are turning Postgres into an Application Runtime. Why? Because we believe that code and data are inseparable in pretty much all of the line-of-business application systems. Turns out, when done this way, applications work a lot faster, require a lot less maintenance, and are simply easier to write.Our foundation is open source and is available at https://github.com/omnigres/omnigresWe're backed by some great early-stage VCs and looking to onboard people who can move quickly, learn on the go, and maintain the focus on the goals. Another way to look at it is that we want to meet other pragmatic idealists.Email: founders@omnigres.com

Carl Zeiss SMT/SMS | Jena/Oberkochen/Rossdorf &amp; remote, Germany | Multiple Roles | Full-Time | Hybrid (some onsite required) | English, some German very helpful | https://www.zeiss.de/semiconductor-manufacturing-technology/...Zeiss SMT is the leader in extreme engineering optics for semiconductor manufacturing. We come up every so often on HN as leaders in EUV optics manufacturing for ASML scanners. SMS is a branch of SMT concerned with standalone tooling for quality assurance and defect inspection in semiconductor fabs (tools like the AIMS EUV or PROVE systems, for example). We bring complete solutions to the hypercompetitive market that is the semiconductor industry. The scale is vast – the work you can be involved in ranges from simulations at the nanometer to how to ship tools via using Boeing 747(s).Software (and extremely diligent/precise engineering… honestly it blows my mind regularly) underpins everything we do and spans the same vastness of scale. We (Zeiss SMT, but also SMS where I work) are hiring in pretty much every IT field as we modernize systems, upgrade legacy code, and build cutting-edge new tools and platforms to remain at the front of the field. Specifically interesting to HN (I think) is my team, which works on developing extremely fast physics simulation and data processing code utilizing classical algorithms, machine learning, and _AI_, all on premise. We also build and maintain the hardware (HPC clusters) to enable these developments.Desirable skills
Python (scientific, HPC, ML, physics simulation), image analysis (big, big data processing, very fast), CUDA, C++, HPC architecture design/on premise rack configuration, HPC admin, DevOps infrastructure (physical as well as CI/CD), GPGPU programming, FPGA programming, QA engineering, KubernetesI can post some job links tomorrow, but if you have questions please either comment or reach out to me at thomas dot pekin at zeiss dot com. I’ve been working here for a year and it’s a lot of fun.

Oso | Product Engineer | New York City (NYC) | Onsite or Hybrid*Old problem, new $25B+ market*Companies like AWS, Stripe, and Twilio have shown that if a technology isn't core to your value proposition, you should offload it. Still, every engineering team builds and rebuilds one piece: authorization, how you control who has access to what in your app. We intend to change that.We see a world where developers never roll their own authorization again, and instead say, "Just use Oso" – the same way you might say, "Oh, you should just use Postgres for that."

Taxwire | Founding Engineer (Backend) | Remote or NYC in-person (preferred) | Full-Time | $100-$200k + equity + benefitsTaxwire is solving a frustrating problem that every business has to deal with: sales tax. If you haven’t dealt with the problem firsthand: the US alone has over 10,000 legal jurisdictions, each with their own set of rules locked up in outdated government websites and PDFs. Our job is to understand these rules, understand company data, match them together, and build services to automate all the tedious work. We’re using experts, automation, and ML to do this better than it has ever been done.We have raised a large initial funding round from institutional investors in Ramp, Expensify, and more, and we are hiring our first two engineers. We care deeply about intentionality around remote, async, and writing-first culture, having led fully remote teams and orgs at Series B companies.This is a great role for someone who wants to work on a seriously painful problem with massive TAM, and someone who loves reverse engineering, data-driven “expert + LLM” systems, and who wants a core role in building a team and company from the ground up.Email me (CTO) at steven+hn@taxwire.co.

Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco &amp; Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer
In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.Open positions include:* Staff and Senior Health Data Engineer* Senior Software Engineer - Program Development Kit Engine* Staff Software Engineer, Data Serving* Staff Software Engineer, Production ApplicationsJobs Board: https://bit.ly/nuna-job-boardFrontend: React, TypescriptBackend: Django, Python, ScalaCloud: AWSQuestions?

Graphistry | Viz engineer | Security engineer | Contract | REMOTE - GLOBAL | https://www.graphistry.com + https://www.louie.aiGraphistry is a Gartner-awarded startup used by fraud/cyber/BI/supplychain/misinfo/... analysts to see and correlate using our visual graph AI platform. With louie.ai (generative AI), they can now talk with their many databases in natural language while having L.O.U.I.E. generate the queries, GPU visualizations, &amp; analyses for them.We partner with companies like Nvidia &amp; AWS to enable end-to-end GPU compute so operational teams can do all this at previously impossible scales and interactivity. Some projects folks may know us for include having donated the web tier of Apache Arrow used by performance-oriented data visualization frameworks, incubating what became Nvidia RAPIDS.AI, and our own server&lt;&gt;client GPU accelerated data visualization engine.We are looking for multiple candidates:- Visualization engineer - Scaling server/client GPU infoviz  We are looking for a visualization engineer excited about enabling analysts to dig into bigger and trickier data. The near-term projects are around initiatives like increasing our visual scale another 100X (client GLSL &lt;&gt; server RAPIDS.ai GPU) and improving how analysts understand and collaborate (React, node, RAPIDS GPU). You’ll be working with our full-stack team, partners like Nvidia, and as we are a user-focused team, you’ll also have the chance to chat directly with analysts in our community channels and engage with their data teams. Over time, you’ll take ownership of increasing parts of the full stack GPU visualization pipeline and its direction. Global remote friendly, long-term (1yr+), and option of contract vs full-time (equity etc).

- Security engineer - AI code sandbox hardening  We’re looking for a security engineer (any time zone) to design, implement, test, and harden the AI code sandbox  louie.ai uses to secure untrusted code execution . You will collaborate with our architects and developers as we prepare the surrounding application for third-party security auditing and pen testing. You should have some familiarity with Linux and container security practices and tools such as libseccomp policies, strace, iptables, and container networking. Ideally you have worked on sandbox and jail breaking technology before from a attacker/defender side, and OS/network/container/VM isolation mechanisms in general. You must be _very_ comfortable with Python + Docker. This is a 2-4w initial project. Global/remote fine, with key meetings on PDT (US) time zones.

Spacelift | Remote | Europe | Full-time | Senior Software EngineerWe're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://spacelift.teamtailor.com/jobs/3006934-software-engin...You can find out more about the product we're building at https://spacelift.io and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: https://spacelift.io/blog/engineering

Paratus Ltd | REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus | Full-timeParatus is a young company with a first-of-a-kind insurance product to protect businesses from price risk. Since our launch three years ago, we've demonstrated the viability of our model with a product protecting the shipping industry from changes in fuel price, and are now undergoing a large expansion into other sectors - particularly renewables and decarbonisation. Our new product for wind and solar farms protects them from falls in the price of electricity, and so makes investing in renewable power safer.I have been Paratus's CTO / sole full-time developer at Paratus for three years (working with specialist contractors as required for UX, security etc), but we're looking to increase the team size to four to support substantially increased demand and expansion of the company. Our initial role will be to support the sales team by maintaining and enhancing our pricing model, with a natural pivot into expanding our books-and-records system as sales pick up. In the medium term, there's the prospect of interesting new development work as increased capacity allows us to automate new parts of the business flow.Senior Developer - £100k+ (negotiable depending on experience/fit etc)The key thing we're looking for from our second developer hire is that they should be able to stand in for me in a pinch. Specifically:• You should be comfortable and familiar with the core of our tech stack (Java / Spring / PostgreSQL / AWS).• You should need be able to get up to speed quickly on an unfamiliar project and, after a short period of orientation, be able to self-teach / find your way around on your own.• A key requirement is that you should be able to cover for me if I become sick or unavailable - you should quickly reach the point where you can reliably carry out urgent development work unsupported.• A mathematical background would be a plus - our pricing model is somewhat technical and one of the key things we need to support.• As the team grows, you should be able to skill up quickly enough to be able to support and mentor less experienced developers who still need some help finding their way around.• Being able to assist with interview and recruitment processes would also be a plus.Developer - £60k-85k• You should have experience writing software as part of a team, using Git or other version control.• You should know how to write automated tests and understand why they are important.• You don't need to have the depth of experience necessary to become fully autonomous on day one, but once you understand a task and the area of the codebase you're changing, you should be capable of working reliably and independently.Please email a CV / cover letter to careers@paratusltd.com to apply.
